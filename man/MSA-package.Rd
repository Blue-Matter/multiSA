\title{MSA: Multi-stock Assessment with Regional Spatiotemporal Dynamics}
\description{
Implementation of a next-generation, multi-stock age-structured fisheries assessment model. `MSA` is intended for use in mixed fisheries where stock composition can not be readily identified in fishery data alone, e.g., from catch and age/length composition. Models can be fitted to genetic data, e.g., stock composition of catches and close-kin pairs, with seasonal stock availability and movement.
