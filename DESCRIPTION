Description: Implementation of a next-generation, multi-stock age-structured fisheries assessment model. 
  `multiSA` is intended for use in mixed fisheries where stock composition can not be readily identified in 
  fishery data alone, e.g., from catch and age/length composition. Models can be fitted to genetic data, 
  e.g., stock composition of catches and close-kin pairs, with seasonal stock availability and movement.
